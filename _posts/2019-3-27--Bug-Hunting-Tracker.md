Hi friends, I am CodeNinja and this blog post is inspire by https://sadjy.github.io


The best thing in todays day is be creative and curious to do things of interest.

Make a very good plan and stick with it.

So, with creative mind i made plan to make a template on Bug Hunting Targets and stick with it on all other Target Projects.

So, without wasting my time here is my Day - 1 

===============================================

Day 1 :->

As i can't sit longer on laptop because of my eye i created template first in first day.

First task was to choose the target and i choosed it
No matter i get vulnerability or not but starting is the crucial for me

Patience and Persistance is the key in bug hunting world.


So, I choose target -> Ford website from Hackerone
Even I know many other targetting it but i am here to learn so no worry about it.

Here are the all screenshots of my Notion Notes and Linux Setup arrangements
